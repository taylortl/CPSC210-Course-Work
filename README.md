## Ride booking system for a day 
Author: Choi Ian Leong, Taylor

***About This Application*** \
The application provides a ride booking system for customers within 10 zones. 
The bookings can only be made on the same day and fees are charged according to the distance between zones.
Bookings can only be cancelled 1 hour in advance.
This application is provided for all individuals living within the 10 zones. 
Zones are not specified in this application to make the application portable.
Meaning that the application is applicable to any places that can be divided into zones. 

This application is different from other ride service, customers get to choose the drivers on their own according to the ranking of drivers.
If there's no drivers available in the zone, customer can choose to book again later or choose a driver from another zone. 
However, choosing drivers from other zone will cost additional fee. 

***Interest*** \
This application can test my knowledge in file system and the data structure in programming.
