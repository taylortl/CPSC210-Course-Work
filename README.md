# Ride booking system for a day 


***About This Application*** \
The application provides a ride booking system for customers within 5 zones. 
The bookings can only be made on the same day and fees are charged according to the distance between zones. 
Distance and duration of ride is determined by the difference of zone number.
A ride within one zone takes 1 hour, ride between zones takes (1 + difference) hours. 
Booking can only be cancelled if the driver is in the starting zone before the ride and the booking is not rated.
In other words, if the user is choosing a driver from another zone, that ride cannot be cancelled.

This application is different from other ride service, customers get to choose the drivers on their own according to the rating of drivers.
If there's no drivers available in the zone, customer can choose a driver from another zone. 
However, choosing drivers from other zone will cost additional fee and cannot be cancelled.
This application is provided for all individuals living within the 5 zones.
Zones are not specified to any location in real life in this application just to make the application portable.
Meaning that the application is applicable to any places that can be divided into 5 zones.

***Interest*** \
I'm interested in making this taxi service application because we don't get to choose the drivers in most of the ride booking system nowadays.
Sometimes, we may be matched with relatively worse drivers, the driver could be bad in driving or in attitude.
And I understand as a customer, I don't want to pay for an unpleasant ride, it's better to choose the drivers we want.
This system can also force the drivers to improve their skills or attitude, which makes unpleasant rides avoidable.
